# Full Focus Mode 🌌

**Full Focus Mode** is a distraction-free writing environment plugin for Tintero, designed to immerse you completely in your creative flow. When you enter Full Focus Mode, say goodbye to toolbars, notifications, and clutter—it's just you, your words, and the infinite canvas.

## Key Features

### 🧘 **Immersive Distraction-Free Environment**
*   **True Fullscreen**: Automatically enters fullscreen mode to eliminate OS distractions.
*   **Minimalist UI**: Hides all unnecessary controls. The interface fades away, leaving only your text.
*   **Constellation Background**: A subtle, animated starry background provides a calm, deep-focus atmosphere without being intrusive.

### 📜 **Typewriter Scrolling & Focus**
*   **Active Line Focus**: Your current typing line stays fixed at a comfortable eye level (~35% down the screen).
*   **Automatic Scroll**: As you write, the page moves up automatically—just like a classic typewriter. You never have to manually scroll to keep your cursor visible.
*   **History Blur**: Previously written text gently fades and blurs out, keeping your attention locked on the present thought.

### ⏱️ **Flexible Session Timer**
*   **Quick Presets**: Jump straight into a writing sprint with 5m, 10m, 30m, 1h, or 2h timers.
*   **Infinite Mode**: Write without time constraints using the "∞" option.
*   **Custom Duration**: Set a precise writing goal down to the second (HH:MM:SS).
*   **Session Stats**: Track your remaining time, word count, and current Words Per Minute (WPM) live.

### 📁 **Seamless Workflow**
*   **Project Integration**: Write directly into your existing Tintero project files or create new ones on the fly.
*   **Auto-Append**: Choose to append your sprint text to an existing note or start fresh.
*   **Safety**: Your work is saved automatically to your project when the session ends.

## How to Use

1.  **Open the Plugin**: Click the "Full Focus" icon in the Tintero sidebar.
